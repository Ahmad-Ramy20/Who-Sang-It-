Kendrick Lamar,Alright,"Alls my life I has to fight  nigga
Alls my life I
Hard times like  yah!
Bad trips like  yah!
Nazareth  I'm fucked up
Homie  you fucked up
But if God got us then we gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me  do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
Do you hear me  do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Uh  and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like
Lord knows  twenty of 'em in my Chevy
Tell 'em all to come and get me  reapin' everything I sow
So my karma come in heaven  no preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record  uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls  I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt  been down before  nigga
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like  Where do we go  nigga?
And we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure  nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me  do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
Do you hear me  do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want you  a house? You  a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano  a guitar?
Anything  see my name is Lucy  I'm your dog
Motherfucker  you can live at the mall
I can see the evil  I can tell it I know when it's illegal
I don't think about it  I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy  paint it on the regal
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit  big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic  get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico ah!
I don't talk about it  be about it  everyday I see cool
If I got it then you know you got it  Heaven  I can reach you
Pat Dawg  Pat Dawg  Pat Dawg  my dog  that's all
Bick back and Chad  I trap the bag for y'all
I rap  I black on track so rest assured
My rights  my wrongs  I write 'til I'm right with God

Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga  we gon' be alright
Do you hear me  do you feel me? We gon' be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence  sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct  the evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers","Alright Alls my life I has to fight  nigga

Kendrick Lamar,Not Like Us,"Psst, I see dead people
(Mustard on the beat, ho)
Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, ""Breathe, bro""
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minorrr

They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and burnt bitches, go
The audience not dumb
Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The ""Other Vaginal Option""? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy
Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar

Mm

Kendrick Lamar,Meet The Grahams,"Dear Adonis
I'm sorry that that man is your father  let me be honest
It takes a man to be a man  your dad is not responsive
I look at him and wish your grandpa woulda wore a condom
I'm sorry that you gotta grow up and then stand behind him
Life is hard  I know  the challenge is always gon' beat us home
Sometimes our parents make mistakes that affect us until we grown
And you're a good kid that need good leadership
Let me be your mentor since your daddy don't teach you shit
Never let a man piss on your leg  son
Either you die right there or pop that man in the head  son
Never fall in the escort business  that's bad religion
Please remember  you could be a bitch even if you got bitches
Never code-switch  whether right or wrong  you're a Black man
Even if it don't benefit your goals  do some push-ups  get some discipline
Don't cut them corners like your daddy did  fuck what Ozempic did
Don't pay to play with them Brazilians  get a gym membership
Understand  no throwin' rocks and hidin' hands  that's law
Don't be ashamed 'bout who you wit'  that's how he treat your moms
Don't have a kid to hide a kid to hide again  be sure
Five percent will comprehend  but ninety-five is lost
Be proud of who you are  your strength come from within
Lotta superstars that's real  but your daddy ain't one of them
And you nothing like him  you'll carry yourself as king
Can't understand me right now? Just play this when you eighteen

Dear Dennis  you gave birth to a master manipulator
Even usin' you to prove who he is is a huge favor
I think you should ask for more paper  and more paper
And more  uh  more paper

Psychopath intuition  the man that like to play victim
You raised a horrible fuckin' person  the nerve of you  Dennis
Sandra  sit down  what I'm about to say is heavy  now listen
Mm-mm  your son's a sick man with sick thoughts  I think niggas like him should die
Him and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest their life
He hates Black women  hypersexualizes 'em with kinks of a nympho fetish
Grew facial hair because he understood bein' a beard just fit him better
He got sex offenders on ho-VO that he keep on a monthly allowance
A child should never be compromised and he keepin' his child around them
And we gotta raise our daughters knowin' there's predators like him lurkin'
Fuck a rap battle  he should die so all of these women can live with a purpose
I been in this industry twelve years  I'ma tell y'all one lil' secret
It's some weird shit goin' on and some of these artists be here to police it
They be streamlinin' victims all inside of they home and callin' 'em tender
Then leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas
To any woman that be playin' his music  know that you're playin' your sister
Or better  you're sellin' your niece to the weirdos  not the good ones
Katt Williams said  Get you the truth  so I'ma get mines
The Embassy 'bout to get raided too  it's only a matter of time
Ayy  LeBron  keep the family away  hey  Curry  keep the family away
To anybody that embody the love for their kids  keep the family away
They lookin' at you too if you standin' by him  keep the family away
I'm lookin' to shoot through any pervert that lives  keep the family safe
  
Dear baby girl
I'm sorry that your father not active inside your world
He don't commit to much but his music  yeah  that's for sure
He a narcissist  misogynist  livin' inside his songs
Try destroyin' families rather than takin' care of his own
Should be teachin' you time tables or watchin' Frozen with you
Or at your eleventh birthday singin' poems with you
Instead  he be in Turks payin' for sex and poppin' Percs  examples that you don't deserve
I wanna tell you that you're loved  you're brave  you're kind
You got a gi to change the world  and could change your father's mind
'Cause our children is the future  but he lives inside confusion
Money's always been illusion  but that's the life he's used to
His father prolly didn't claim him neither
History do repeats itself  sometimes it don't need a reason
But I would like to say it's not your fault that he's hidin' another child
Give him grace  this the reason I made Mr. Morale
So our babies like you can cope later
Give you some confidence to go through somethin'  it's hope later
I never wanna hear you chase a man 'cause it's feral behavior
Sittin' in the club with sugar daddies for validation
You need to know that love is eternity and trumps all pain
I'll tell you who your father is  just play this song when it rains
Yes  he's a hitmaker  songwriter  superstar  right
And a fuckin' deadbeat that should never say more life
Meet the Grahams
Dear Aubrey
I know you probably thinkin' I wanted to crash your party
But truthfully  I don't have a hatin' bone in my body
This supposed to be a good exhibition within the game
But you fucked up the moment you called out my family's name
Why you had to stoop so low to discredit some decent people?
Guess integrity is lost when the metaphors doesn't reach you
And I like to understand 'cause your house was never a home
Thirty-seven  but you showin' up as a seven-year-old
You got gamblin' problems  drinkin' problems  pill-poppin' and spendin' problems
Bad with money  whorehouse
Solicitin' women problems  therapy's a lovely start
But I suggest some ayahuasca  strip the ego from the bottom
I try to empathize with you 'cause I know that you ain't been through nothin'
Crave entitlement  but wanna be liked so bad that it's puzzlin'
No dominance  let's recap moments when you didn't fit in
No secret handshakes with your friend
No culture cachet to binge  just disrespectin' your mother
Identity's on the fence  don't know which family will love ya
The skin that you livin' in is compromised in personas
Can't channel your masculine even when standin' next to a woman
You a body shamer  you gon' hide them baby mamas  ain't ya?
You embarrassed of 'em  that's not right  that ain't how mama raised us
Take that mask off  I wanna see what's under them achievements
Why believe you? You never gave us nothin' to believe in
'Cause you lied about religious views  you lied about your surgery
You lied about your accent and your past tense  all is perjury
You lied about your ghostwriters  you lied about your crew members
They all pussy  you lied on 'em  I know they all got you in 'em
You lied about your son  you lied about your daughter  huh
You lied about them other kids that's out there hopin' that you come
You lied about the only artist that can offer you some help
Fuck a rap battle  this a long life battle with yourself","Meet The Grahams Dear Adonis

You need to know that love is eternity and trumps all pain
I'll tell you who your father is  just play this song when it rains
Yes  he's a hitmaker  songwriter  superstar  right
And a fuckin' deadbeat that should never say more life
Meet the Grahams
Dear Aubrey
I know you probably thinkin' I wanted to crash your party
But truthfully  I don't have a hatin' bone in my body
This supposed to be a good exhibition within the game
But you fucked up the moment you called out my family's name
Why you had to stoop so low to discredit some decent people?
Guess integrity is lost when the metaphors doesn't reach you
And I like to understand 'cause your house was never a home
Thirty-seven  but you showin' up as a seven-year-old
You got gamblin' problems  drinkin' problems  pill-poppin' and spendin' problems
Bad with money  whorehouse
Solicitin' women problems  therapy's a lovely start
But I suggest some ayahuasca  strip the ego from the bottom
I try to empathize with you 'cause I know that you ain't been through nothin'
Crave entitlement  but wanna be liked so bad that it's puzzlin'
No dominance  let's recap moments when you didn't fit in
No secret handshakes with your friend
No culture cachet to binge  just disrespectin' your mother
Identity's on the fence  don't know which family will love ya
The skin that you livin' in is compromised in personas
Can't channel your masculine even when standin' next to a woman
You a body shamer  you gon' hide them baby mamas  ain't ya?
You embarrassed of 'em  that's not right  that ain't how mama raised us
Take that mask off  I wanna see what's under them achievements
Why believe you? You never gave us nothin' to believe in
'Cause you lied about religious views  you lied about your surgery
You lied about your accent and your past tense  all is perjury
You lied about your ghostwriters  you lied about your crew members
They all pussy  you lied on 'em  I know they all got you in 'em
You lied about your son  you lied about your daughter  huh
You lied about them other kids that's out there hopin' that you come
You lied about the only artist that can offer you some help
Fuck a rap battle  this a long life battle with yourself"

Them superpowers getting neutralized  I can only watch in silence
The famous actor we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now spiralin'
You're movin' just like a degenerate  every antic is feelin' distasteful
I calculate you're not as calculated  I can even predict your angle
Fabricating stories on the family front 'cause you heard Mr. Morale
A pathetic master manipulator  I can smell the tales on you now
You're not a rap artist  you a scam artist with the hopes of being accepted
Tommy Hilfiger stood out  but FUBU never had been your collection
I make music that electrify 'em  you make music that pacify 'em
I can double down on that line  but spare you this time  that's random acts of kindness
Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too
But don't tell no lie about me and I won't tell truths 'bout you

Nigga  I'm reapin' what I sow  okay
Got a Benjamin and a Jackson all in my house like I'm Joe  okay
Hellcat  made his homeboys and them type sell they soul  okay
Everybody wanna be demon 'til they get chipped by your throwaway
And I might do a show a day  once a lame  always a lame
Oh  you thought the money  the power or fame would make you go away?
Have you ever played have-you-ever? Okay  nigga  let's play
Have you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?
Have you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case?
Well  I have  and I failed at both  but I came out straight
I hate when a rapper talk about guns  then somebody die
They turn into nuns  then hop online  like Pray for my city
He fakin' for likes and digital hugs
His daddy a killer  he wanna be junior  they must've forgot the shit that they done
Dementia must run in his family  but let it get shaky
I'll park your son
The very first time I shot me a Drac'  the homie had told me to aim it this way
I didn't point down enough  today  I'll show you I learned from those mistakes
Somebody had told me that you got a ring  on God  I'm ready to double the wage
I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave
Cutthroat business  you got shit twisted
What is it? The braids?
I hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay
It's three G.O.A.T.s le   and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage
I love 'em to death  and in eight bars  I'll explain that phrase  huh
It's nothin' nobody can tell me  huh
I don't wanna talk on no celly  huh
You know I got language barriers  huh
It's no accent you can sell me  huh

I don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell  for him  I inherit the beef

You better off spinnin' again on him  you think about pushin' me
He's Terrence Thornton  I'm Terence Crawford  yeah  I'm whoopin' feet
We ain't gotta get personal  this a friendly fade  you should keep it that way
I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint
This ain't been about critics  not about gimmicks  not about who the greatest
It's always been about love and hate  now let me say I'm the biggest hater
I hate the way that you walk  the way that you talk  I hate the way that you dress
I hate the way that you sneak diss  if I catch flight  it's gon' be direct
We hate the bitches you fuck  'cause they confuse themself with real women
And notice  I said we  it's not just me  I'm what the culture feelin'
How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough?
How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?
I like Drake with the melodies  I don't like Drake when he act tough
You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff  let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin'
Yeah  my first one like my last one  it's a classic  you don't have one
Let your core audience stomach that  then tell 'em where you get your abs from
V12  it's a fast one  baow-baow-baow  last one
Headshot for the year  you better walk around like Da Punk

Surprised you wanted that feature request
You know that we got some shit to address
I even hate when you say the word nigga  but that's just me  I guess
Some shit just cringeworthy  it ain't even gotta be deep  I guess
Still love when you see success  everything with me is blessed
Keep makin' me dance  wavin' my hand  and it won't be no threat
I'm knowin' they call you The Boy  but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet
Matter fact  I ain't even bleed him yet  can I bleed him? Bet
When I see you stand by Sexyy Red  I believe you see two bad bitches
I believe you don't like women  it's real competition  you might pop ass with 'em

Hoe  what? You ain't like that record?
Back To Back  I like that record
I'ma get back to that  for the record
Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?
That's hoe shit  I got a son to raise  but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Wakin' him up  know nothin' 'bout that
And tell him to pray  know nothin' 'bout that
And givin' him tools to walk through life like day-by-day  know nothin' 'bout that
Teachin' him morals  integrity  discipline  listen  man  you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin'  you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Ain't 20-v-1  it's 1-v-20 if I gotta smack niggas that write with you

Funny  he was in a film called AI
And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him
I'ma blick niggas all in they coffin
Yeah  OV-hoe niggas is dick riders
Tell 'em run to America  they imitate heritage  they can't imitate this violence
What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast
And I'm fine with it  I'll push the line with it
Pick a nigga off one at a time with it
We can be on a three-hour time difference
Don't speak on the family  crodie
It can get deep in the family  crodie

Michael Jackson,Childhood,"Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from

So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down  it was her doom

Sounding heartbeats  intimidations

Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, ""Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons""
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room

This shit make a nigga just wanna write
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never grow to 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun
How come your tongue say, ""killa"" then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
'Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
I'm from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look-alike
Hope another homicide don't numb you a nun do
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon
That's a error, you can smell it in the air
And everybody really doomed
That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
All y'all can suck my dick
All them days at the county building
I'm 'bout to make my mama rich
Cartoons and (Cereal!) I ain't felt this (Good since!)
Scrooge McDuck (Here we go!), elementary hood shit

This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
Even with a pot to piss in
I'ma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Dark Wing Duck lost service
Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
Emerging on everbody corner (Dash for it)
Get a toe tag when you play tag
With a task of a new (Task force)
Everybody wanna know my life

Let my life loose in this booth, just for you
Muhfucka, hope y'all amused!
I did wrong, karma came
Crackers gave me ball and chain
Friends, enemies all the same
State, fed, both can hang
Nobody can't mute me
But I never said nobody can't shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
Everyday feel like the one before
Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
If you do what you always done
Then you get what you always got
You dumb buffoons!
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
For about the past 72 hours
Hand on my heart, face to the hood
I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
Yeah, this me, no mic
No cameras, no lights, just pain
Mama, how much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money come with lots of stains
Road to riches come with lots of lanes
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain


Just another player with lots of game

Wanna lose weight and keep eating
For you
Hey, whats up doc?


Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, ""Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons""
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room

This shit make a nigga just wanna write
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never grow to 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun
How come your tongue say, ""killa"" then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
'Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
I'm from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look-alike
Hope another homicide don't numb you a nun do
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon
That's a error, you can smell it in the air
And everybody really doomed
That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
All y'all can suck my dick
All them days at the county building
I'm 'bout to make my mama rich
Cartoons and (Cereal!) I ain't felt this (Good since!)
Scrooge McDuck (Here we go!), elementary hood shit

Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her

This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
Even with a pot to piss in
I'ma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Dark Wing Duck lost service
Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
Emerging on everbody corner (Dash for it)
Get a toe tag when you play tag
With a task of a new (Task force)
Everybody wanna know my life
How did I make it (Past yours)
